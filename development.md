## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow React best practices with functional components
- Use React hooks for state and side effects
- Apply proper naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Document complex components with JSDoc comments
- Maintain consistent code formatting with ESLint

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images and assets
- Lazy load components and routes
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement proper code splitting

### Animation Guidelines
- Use GSAP for complex timeline animations
- Use Framer Motion for component transitions
- Keep animations smooth (60fps target)
- Provide reduced motion alternatives for accessibility
- Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

### Accessibility Standards
- Maintain proper color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide proper ARIA attributes
- Support screen readers
- Implement focus management
